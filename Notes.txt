This is a list of bugs and fixes as of plato v0.0.2 and socrates v0.0.3

one big area in plato was " or normalized_data[0] in question_starts " in the question reasong as it give false posatives for sentaces such as 
"when it rains it pours" this is not a question however when is the start of a question acording to the question start list so it comes down to
fix for this i feel i need to maybe remove it or add a differnt weight and then have it change the outcome by pickingthe item with the bigest 
weight however that is more advanced than the versions i am on so for now it will be a remove job. Later i will have the code run through each 
section and give each a weight based on the likely hood it is correct similar to an ai model.
