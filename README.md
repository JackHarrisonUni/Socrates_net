> “An examined network is a secure network.”  
_A Python Network Security & Intrusion Detection Toolkit_

---

## Overview
**Socrates.Net** is a modular **Python-based network security suite** designed to help identify anomalies, analyze packets, and simulate basic intrusion detection.  

This project follows Edge Hill University’s *Red Thread* development structure — expanding weekly with new features as programming concepts are introduced.

---

## Features (Planned / In Development)
- **socrates.py**         Central orchestrator
- **plato.py**            Logic and reasoning structures
- **lyceum.py**           Knowledge store (files/logs)
- **epictetus.py**        Error handler
- **sentinel.py**         Monitoring/logging
- **hermes.py**           Network or message module

---

# Update Notes
- **Plato
